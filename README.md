### **Running locally**

Before starting doing any changes I recommend to import project into IDE and then perform any changes form there.
Moreover, from pricing reason I recommend doing first run from IDE.

To successfully run application locally you have to do the following:
1. Paste your API key and secret, obtained from Vonage page, to VonageClient builder in `Sender` object.
2. Change receiver phone number to actually existing number. (Remember about country code)

Example for Poland: `48123456798`.

Page with country codes: `https://countrycode.org/`.
